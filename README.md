# gba-mus-ripper-gui
A graphical frontend for my fork of Bregalad's 'gba-mus-ripper' program

To run this program from source, you will need to obtain the latest binaries of my gba_mus_ripper fork, and place the 4 executables
in the same directory as the gba_mus_ripper_gui executable.

NOTE: Currently this program only works properly under Windows, I do not know if Linux support will be possible to add due to the way
this program works.
