# gba-mus-ripper-gui
A graphical frontend for my fork of Bregalad's 'gba-mus-ripper' program

To run this program from source using Qt Creator, you will need to obtain the latest binaries of my gba_mus_ripper fork, and place the 4 executables
in the same directory as the gba_mus_ripper_gui executable.

If you want to build and run this program from source as a standalone executable release, you will need to follow the above steps,
and also copy the files "Qt5Core.dll", "Qt5Widgets.dll", and "Qt5Gui.dll" from "(your Qt installation directory)\5.6\mingw49_32\bin\"
into the program's directory.

Or, if you don't want to go through all that trouble, simply download the latest release from the "Releases" tab of this page.

NOTE: Currently this program only works properly under Windows, I do not know if Linux support will be possible to add due to the way
this program works.
